Sphinx extensions for embedded plots, math and more
****************************************************

Sphinx is written in python, and supports the ability to write custom
extensions.  We've written a few for the matplotlib documentation,
some of which are part of matplotlib itself in the
matplotlib.sphinxext module, some of which are included only in the
sphinx doc directory, and there are other extensions written by other
groups, eg numpy and ipython.
